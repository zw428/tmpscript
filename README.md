This is a script for making temporary scripts (for quick moves, etc).

![example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zw428/tmpscript/41dc1c652b1c9dff3c942fc6a255d9e98b1a9b0d/ex.gif)

Usage: `tmpscript arg1 arg2...`, and each arg will be on its own line in a file
that pops up based on the `EDITOR` variable. If you make changes to the
file, the file will be run as a script.
